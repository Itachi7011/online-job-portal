However, given the level of competition and the continuous evolution of the market, simply having a stellar academic record isn’t enough; it is simply the prerequisite.
          <br />

        <h3>1. Decide what you want to do</h3>
        <h5>

        <h3> 2. Work on your communication skills </h3>


        <h5>
          Communication skills are extremely important in today's business industry. They can often be the differentiator between two candidates possessing the same academic record.
          <br />

          Since the domestic markets are now condensing into one huge global market, job seekers must master communication in English, which is recognized as the global language.

          Almost every job in the industry today requires the candidate to have some prior work experience. Internships can help you greatly in this regard.

          Not only would you be able to show your employer that you've experienced a work environment before, but it will also help you to hone your skillset.

          According to a survey report by Compare Camp, 70% of companies offer interns a full-time job, and 80% of interns accept such offers.

          Organizations do not shortlist such resumes as they are looking for candidates who are suitable for the role.

      <div className="careerTips2ndDiv">

        <h5>
          Maybe you are just getting started in your IT career and looking for the best approach to take to gain experience quickly and advance. Or maybe you already have spent a few years or even a few decades in IT, but you feel a little stuck in your current role or position, even as the tech space is expanding and your peers seem to be moving ahead.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          Whatever the case, learning from the experience of other IT professionals can save you time and money as you work to get to the next phase of your career as an IT professional.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          InformationWeek spoke to several IT professionals and leaders recently and asked them for their top piece of advice for other IT pros just getting started or in a mid-career state of limbo. Here's a collection of some of the best advice we heard. </h5>

        <h3> 1. Cultivate an always-learning mindset </h3>

        <h5>

          Technology is a field that is always changing, and the change is coming faster than it ever has before. With that kind of acceleration, along with the fact that technology is becoming intrinsic to every part of the business or organization, it's important to develop a mindset that you need to always be learning.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          "In IT you always have to keep learning," said Sherman Gossett, a quality assurance engineer at iSolved HCM. "It's not just four years of university and do your job. You have to really want to search for new knowledge. Enjoy that search, especially nowadays with technology shifting so quickly."
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          Deborah Graham, senior business intelligence developer at UMass Memorial Health Care agreed.

          "Never stop learning," she said. "I can't think of any better advice. There is always going to be something new coming down the pike. Big change is inevitable."
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          Whether it's learning about new technologies like AI and machine learning, or a programming language like Python, or a new way to deploy your infrastructure such as hybrid cloud, learning about these new technologies will keep you and your skills fresh for the changing market.

        </h5>
      </div>

    </div>


    <div className="careerTipsMainDiv">
      <div className="careerTips2ndDiv">

        <h3> 2. Learn the business </h3>


        <h5>
          Sure, it's important to keep up with the fast-moving changes to technology. But if you want to be deeply valuable to your organization you should expand your education beyond technology to the business or organization where you work. The technology doesn't stand alone in an isolated IT department anymore. It underpins the entire organization. That's why your understanding of how the organization works combined with your tech expertise will be deeply valuable to your business.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          "Learn the business you are working for," said Mark Robinson, VP of IT at MY CU Services. He started his career working in a manufacturing environment, and he didn't hesitate then to grab safety glasses and head to the manufacturing floor. "I like to know everything about the business. They used to say I want IT to be aligned with the business. It takes time to learn the products, the strategy, and the markets."
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          Robinson is not alone in this recommendation. Industry leaders say that aligning IT with business goals is essential now that technology has been intertwined with every aspect of the business. But the benefits may go beyond just powering your digital transformation. It's culturally beneficial, too.

      <div className="careerTips2ndDiv">

        <h3> 3. Consider getting into cybersecurity </h3>


        <h5>

          After working in a few different functional areas of IT, one of our respondents who works for a Fortune 500 company moved into cybersecurity and never looked back. If you are looking for job security, interesting work, and the opportunity to work with some of the newest technology available today, cybersecurity is a great field to consider, he said. But there are other benefits, too.<br />  {/* Gap */}

          "Security is good because you have the people interaction, but you also have the tinkering," he said. "You get to look at new products and solutions -- every few years there's new technology to play with."
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          Many areas of IT have become commodities, which make them easier for management to outsource, including networking and software-defined networks, running cables, and even server management. Security is not a commodity. It's always changing and therefore is a fairly secure specialty within IT.

      <div className="careerTips2ndDiv">

        <h3>  4. Develop leadership and management skills </h3>


        <h5>
          The fact that you need technology skills has always been a given in IT. After all, that's what the job is all about. But talk to a few recruiters or a few IT leaders who have climbed the corporate ladder and they will tell you that people skills are also essential. What's more, if you already have a strong technology background, you may want to also work on developing leadership and management skills.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          "IT has always lacked these skills," said Jonathan Vester, VP of Technology and CIO at Nash Community College. "You need to be able to relate to your fellow employees on a personal level and not just be the service that they call when something is broken."
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          As technology evolves into an integral part of every organization, IT professionals who can master both the technology and the people skills will be positioned to advance.

          <br />  {/* Gap */}

        <h3> 5. Work on your public speaking and presentation skills </h3>


        <h5>
          If you solve an IT problem and no one notices, have you really solved it? (Just like that tree that falls in the woods only makes a sound if someone hears it.)
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          Avik Chopra, VP, global head solutions for TTH at NIIT Technologies Ltd., says that public speaking is the most important skill that any technology worker can develop if he or she wants career advancement.

          For instance, Chopra recently attended his company's global summit. The person who was noticed at the summit was the one who presented well. Other presenters may have known the technology inside and out or presented interesting ideas. But if they cannot present that message well, they won't be noticed, and their message will suffer, too.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          "That is what makes you stand out," Chopra said. "Presentation is the No. 1 skill to get you ahead. It's not enough to know something well and do something well. You have to present it well, too."

          Chopra noted that his company employs quite a few IT people who are great at technology.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          "But they don't get ahead because they become a commodity," he said. But if you can present to your coworkers or to clients, you will stand out from the crowd.

        <h3> 1. Triple-Check Your Resume  </h3>


        <h5>
          First things first, you need to have a clean and clear resume. Proofread your resume for any spelling errors. Don't just trust the built-in spell-check program on your device and, if possible, have someone else read it too. Correct any spelling, style, or grammatical mistakes. Then, check it again. You can never proofread your resume too thoroughly

        <h3> 2. Highlight Related Experience </h3>

          It should be emphasized and, if possible, inserted in a highly visible place on the resume if you have

          If your practical job experience or participation in finance-related clubs or organizations is lacking, you might consider either attempting to garner that experience or else emphasizing your other marketable skills, such as your writing ability. Writing experience and a proven ability to communicate effectively are both qualities that are desirable in finance, where professionals and clients work together every day.

        <h3> 3. Year-Round Internships  </h3>


        <h5>

          Often, internship candidates don't give much thought to the internship they are trying to land during certain parts of the year—thinking that they happen only in the summer. But some universities and companies offer co-op positions throughout the year, and many encourage fall and spring internships, which opens up the time that students can be applying and landing intern positions.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}

          So, be open to year-round opportunities. An internship at a good firm at any time of year could potentially lead to positive letters of reference, a much more impressive resume, and perhaps even a future job offer.

        <h3> 4. Apply Early </h3>


        <h5>
          t should go without saying, but you should know the deadline for submitting an application, then make sure that you send it in on time. What's more, when working on your application, you should pay attention to its details; read the instructions carefully and follow them exactly.

          <h4 style={{ background: "red", color: "white", padding: "0.5rem", marginRight: "57rem", borderRadius: "1rem" }}>Important</h4>Internships can be paid or unpaid. When deciding between a paid and unpaid internship, make sure the unpaid internship comes with additional benefits, such as more learning opportunities or a better "brand name" institution.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          Your writing should be neat and easy to read; and preferably, you'll be typing into a computer form. Remember that employers receive a plethora—in some cases hundreds or even thousands—of applications for their internship positions, and making a great first impression is of the utmost importance.

        <h3> 5. Ace That Interview  </h3>


        <h5>
          It also should go without saying that you should be presentable—which generally means conservatively dressed—and on time for your interview. It is a good idea to visit the company's website to gain basic knowledge about the firm and to come prepared with some questions about topic.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}s that interest you.

          You could, for example, ask about the company's strategy, what the employer expects from the intern, or about some of its products or services. Asking intelligent, thoughtful questions during an interview could convey the message that you are a thinker and are truly interested in the position and the organization.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          You also should be prepared to answer questions, and not just about the nuts and bolts of the internship itself.

        <h3> 6. Demonstrate Flexibility </h3>


        <h5>
          Interns may have set job duties. That is, their task might be to simply enter data into spreadsheets all day or to make cold calls; however, many times interns are used as "gofers"—as in go for this, or go for that—and are given tasks that nobody else in the office wants.
          <br />  {/* Gap */}
          As such, your assigned tasks may vary frequently and may not be known by the employer at the time of your interview. For this reason, you should make it clear that you are willing to do grunt work and can be flexible based on the organization's needs.

        <h3> 7. Ask About Full-Time Roles  </h3>


        <h5>
          There is usually no guarantee that an internship will lead to a permanent placement at a company. In some cases, though, it may not hurt to ask about full-time roles either during the interview or once you land the position. In fact, it may be good to ask because it conveys your interest in joining the organization, and gives the company some time to consider the possibility of hiring you full-time or creating a new position for you.
